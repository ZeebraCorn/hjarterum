# hjarterum
This project was made as a challenge to use a design and colors I usually wonâ€™t use. I also wanted to learn more about Tailwind and used this project to really try it out. 

HTML and Tailwind CSS was used for this project, and also Alpine JS for the responsive menu. 
For the housing page Swiper was used for the image carousel. On the apartment page Alpine JS was used to change between the images and in the responsive design Swiper was used.
